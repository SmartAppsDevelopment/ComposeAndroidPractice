## Where To go From here
*   A UI/Material Design sample. The interface of the app is deliberately kept simple to focus on architecture. Check out [Plaid](https://github.com/android/plaid) instead.
*   A complete Jetpack sample covering all libraries. Check out [Android Sunflower](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-sunflower) or the advanced [Github Browser Sample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/GithubBrowserSample) instead.
*   A real production app with network access, user authentication, etc. Check out the [Google I/O app](https://github.com/google/iosched), [Santa Tracker](https://github.com/google/santa-tracker-android) or [Tivi](https://github.com/chrisbanes/tivi) for that.
